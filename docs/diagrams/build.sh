# Needs the stack up (`docker compose up -d --wait`) — the schema is read out of the running
# database, because this project has no ORM models for a generator to read (er_schema.py's
# docstring carries that whole argument). Both tools run in throwaway containers and neither
# is installed on this machine or baked into any image in the stack: erdify and mermaid-cli
# are documentation tools, not runtime dependencies.
#
# Every container is `--rm` and runs as the invoking user, so nothing is left behind and no
# output file arrives owned by root.

# with a bare ENOENT that names neither the user nor the mount.
# -s 3 is the whole legibility setting: mermaid lays the diagram out at its natural size
# and this renders it at 3x, which is what makes the column names readable.
