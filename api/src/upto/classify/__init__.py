"""D39's generator: a place's category, produced offline and validated before it is written.

The package splits three ways on purpose. `categories` holds D38's closed list and the
validation D39 rests on; `prompt` holds the version-controlled instruction, which is the
*Skill / Tool / Prompt* artifact §6's re-derivation names; `classify` is the pure step —
a name and a way to ask a model in, one validated category or a stated refusal out.

Nothing here reaches a database or a network. The runner that does both is separate, for
the same reason D43 keeps contributors pure: what can be replayed can be audited.
