"""Ticket 09 — a run leaves a record, including the runs that wrote nothing.

Revision ID: 0005
Revises: 0004
Created: 2026-08-11

**Why this table has to exist before the lineage tool does.** Ticket 09 requires that a model
can ask what a given run wrote *including a run that wrote nothing*, and that a run which
detected no change is "lineage worth pointing at, not an absence". Until now a no-op wrote
literally nothing: item 10 has run about two dozen times and left 1 forecast publication and
6 observation publications, so roughly twenty runs are unrecoverable. D42 made the silent
no-op correct behaviour; it did not make it invisible on purpose, and item 14 is where the
difference starts to matter.

**The publication reference follows D24's pattern rather than inventing one.** D24 pins a
source with a real foreign key and one nullable column per source, because a text column
naming a table is a join nothing can enforce. There are three publication tables, so there are
three nullable columns and a CHECK that at most one is set — and exactly one when the run
stored something.

**What this table is not.** It is not the publication and it does not identify one: D18 and
D35 rule that a publication is identified by its content, and the run stands in only where the
source offers no way to identify one. This records *the attempt* — when it ran, what it found,
and which publication it landed on if any. A run is metadata about our own behaviour; a
publication is a fact about the source.

**Needs a D-number.** The requirement is the ticket's and the shape is this migration's, so
there is no defence entry to point at yet. Recorded in `_map.md` as owed rather than left to be
discovered.

        # row of a table and records `no_change` with 0 here, because the claim short-circuits on
        # a hash it already holds and `ck_ingest_run_rows_only_when_stored` refuses a count on any
        # other outcome. So `sum(rows_written)` reads a backfill as a no-op, and the rebuild lives
        # in `detail`. Ruled 2026-08-18: **this is documented rather than fixed** — a replay is a
        # human recovery action and the human is the reader. **Flip condition:** the day a replay
        # is automated, a separate `rows_rewritten integer` column (NULL, not 0, on runs that
