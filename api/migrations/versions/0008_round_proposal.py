"""Ticket 12 — `round` and `proposal`: the lifecycle half, without the weights.

Revision ID: 0008
Revises: 0007
Created: 2026-08-13

**A room is a round (D52), and the schema says the circle half out loud:** at most one open
round per circle is a partial unique index over unclosed rounds — D52 names the mechanism, this
file writes it. Between rounds a circle simply has no open round; there is no room row anywhere.

**The round carries the meal's hour (D16) and how it was chosen (D41).** A typed hour is fixed;
a defaulted one re-resolves at the roll. The boolean is stored because at roll time the two are
indistinguishable without it, and re-resolving a typed hour silently replaces a fact a person
stated.

**Authorship dies at the close, in the database, in the same transaction (D14).** The close
handler updates a status; the trigger below nulls `proposal.member_id` for that round. It is a
trigger and not application code because a manual close over SQL, a fix-up script, or a second
code path would all leave authorship behind, and none of them would error. D14 admits the
instrument is weaker than a CHECK — a trigger mutates rather than rejects, and Alembic drops
triggers silently on autogenerate, which is why this file is hand-written and read whole.

**The 1–3 cap is enforced here too (§3.0), by a constraint trigger,** because it is the reason
authorship exists at all before the close, and D13's standard is that a rule the application
enforces alone is not a rule. Counting rows across a table is beyond CHECK, so it is the same
weaker instrument as the erasure, admitted rather than glossed.

**What is deliberately absent:** the weight contributions and the materialised per-place
weights — D15's snapshot. They arrive with the engine's write half, because the write-time
reconciliation D15 demands is the engine's act, and a table with no writer yet is a promise
(document-architecture's rule, applied to schema). The winner column is here because the
close needs it (D53: a close is pushed once, with its result), with the one CHECK that can
already be written: an open round has no winner and no close time.

**Admitted, application-enforced for now:** the proposing member belongs to the round's
circle. Stating it in the schema needs a composite key duplicated across three tables; the
API resolves the member through the circle on every write anyway (D67), and the integration
test states the gap so it is a recorded debt rather than an assumption.
