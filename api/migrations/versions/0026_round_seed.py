"""D108's seed commitment, and the tap that reveals it.

Revision 0026, written 2026-08-19 on the owner's ruling (「採用」, `34e8e61`).

**Two columns on `round` and one new table, and the shape of each is an argument.**

`round.seed_commit` — `sha256(seed)` as hex, published from the moment the round opens. This is the
only part of the commitment that may leave the server before close.

`round.outcome_seed` — the 32 bytes themselves. **Server-side only until the round is closed.** A
member holding the seed early can compute the winner and then choose whether to tap, which is
precisely the preference D91 forbids — the same last-revealer attack that ruled out per-member
commit–reveal. The schema cannot enforce that (a column does not know who is reading it); it is
enforced in `api_common`, and the tests assert it over the wire.

**Both nullable, and NULL means the round predates A6.** Nothing is backfilled — the same rule
revision 0021 used for `column_signature`. An old round has no commitment and can never acquire one
honestly, because a commitment made after the places were known is not a commitment.

**`ck_round_seed_pair_whole` keeps the two together.** A `seed_commit` with no seed is a promise
nobody can check; a seed with no commitment is a number nobody promised. Either alone is worse than
neither, so the CHECK is a biconditional rather than two nullable columns that happen to agree.

**`member_roll` stores the tap and NOT the dice, which is the decision worth arguing.**

A member's pair is *derived* from the seed by `upto.engine.draw.pair_for_member`. Storing it as well
would create a second source for the same fact, and the two could disagree — after a restore, after
an edit, after a bug. The round's `die1/die2` are stored because they are the *result* and D69
requires a second roll to return the stored one; a member's own pair is not a result, it is a view of
the seed. So the table records **that** a member tapped and **when**, and the dice come from the
seed every time they are asked for.

Consequence, stated so nobody discovers it: **lose the seed and every pair is gone**, including the
closed rounds'. That is accepted deliberately — the same seed is what makes the round verifiable at
all, so a design that survives losing it would be a design where the dice were never provably fair.

`UNIQUE (round_id, member_id)` makes a second tap idempotent per person, which is D69 applied to a
member rather than to a round. The composite foreign keys are B2's pin: a roll cannot belong to a
member of one circle and a round of another.
