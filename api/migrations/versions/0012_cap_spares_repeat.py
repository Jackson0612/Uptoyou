"""Ticket 19 — the cap trigger steps aside for a repeat proposal.

Revision ID: 0012
Revises: 0011
Created: 2026-08-13

Found by ticket 19's endpoint test, not by reading: a member holding three proposals who
proposes a place **already in the pool** hit the cap trigger before the unique constraint —
BEFORE INSERT runs first — so D70's quiet success read as a §3.0 violation. The two rules
collided in the one case where both apply, and the cap won by execution order alone.

The fix is in the trigger, not the endpoint: when the (round, place) pair already exists,
the trigger lets the row through to the unique constraint, which rejects it with the name
the API maps to 200. The cap still counts only genuinely new proposals, which is what §3.0
meant — a repeat adds nothing to anyone's share of the pool.
