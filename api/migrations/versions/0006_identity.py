"""Ticket 01's identity tables — `circle`, `principal`, `member`.

Revision ID: 0006
Revises: 0005
Created: 2026-08-12

**Three tables, where the ticket names two, and the third is not a convenience.** Ticket 01
asks for `principal` and `member` "with `member.principal_id` as the only link between them".
D12 defines `member` as *one principal's seat in one circle* and rests its entire cost-benefit
on this sentence: "one device holds one secret covering every circle its owner belongs to;
collapsing the two tables would mean a separate secret per circle — **more** data held, not
less." That argument is true only if one principal can hold several member rows, one per
circle, and the thing that says "one per circle" is `UNIQUE (principal_id, circle_id)`. Without
a `circle_id` there is no such constraint to write, and H10's rule is that a constraint goes in
hand-written with the table that carries it. **A constraint that cannot be written yet is not
deferred; it is absent.** Ruled 2026-08-12, three tables, with `circle` as `id · name ·
created_at`.

**`circle`'s columns were chosen here, not taken from a decision entry.** `_map.md` records the
node as "Schema 1 — identity and circles · closed — D12", but D12's body only ever describes
`principal` and `member`; the circle appears in it as a phrase. The closure covered the
*split*, not the circle's shape.

**This is not the baseline migration, and D12 says it is.** The build order put ingest first, so
identity arrives at 0006 behind five ingest revisions. Alembic is linear and nothing is wrong
with the schema, but D12's "a separation that would mean rewriting later goes in from the first
migration" is now literally false about this repository and is owed an amendment.

**What is deliberately absent.** Device secrets, account bindings and invite tokens — D12
describes all three (hashed, never plaintext · `UNIQUE(provider, provider_subject_id)` ·
single-use enforced by a conditional update rather than in application code). They are D7's
surface, ticket 01 does not list them, and they are a separate decision rather than the
obvious next step of this one.

**H19 is a property of this file.** Its mitigation reads "no domain table carries a foreign key
to `principal`; `member` is the only one." Every later migration is bound by that, and this is
the file that makes it true to begin with.
