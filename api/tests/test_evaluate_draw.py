"""D82's draw, the half that needs no database: allocation and determinism.

    python3 app/api/tests/test_evaluate_draw.py

What matters here is that the draw is a *function* — same populations, same seed, same rows
out — because the frozen set's whole claim to comparability rests on the draw being
reproducible against the same publication.
