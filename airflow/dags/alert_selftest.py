"""A10's self-test — the one DAG in this repository that exists to fail.

*Owner-ruled 2026-08-19.*

**The question it answers.** A10 puts an `on_failure_callback` on every task in every DAG, and the
code path was verified piece by piece: the absent-Connection branch, the refused-by-Telegram branch,
the three redactions, and a DagBag load proving all 16 tasks carry the callback. **What none of that
proves is that Airflow calls it when a task really fails.** Every real failure reachable for a test
costs something: breaking the CWA Connection writes a false `failed` row into `ingest_run`, and that
ledger's whole job is telling a broken source from a quiet one — a lie there is worse than an
unproven callback.

So: one task, no source, no ledger row, no side effect, whose only job is to raise. Triggered by
hand, it proves the whole real path at once — Airflow catches the failure, calls the callback, the
message arrives on the phone.

**And it keeps proving it.** That is the larger half of the argument. A monitoring channel nobody can
test is a channel nobody knows is dead: a revoked bot token, a deleted chat, a Connection lost to a
volume reset, all look exactly like a quiet month. This is how "is alerting still working?" gets an
answer in ten seconds instead of waiting for the first real failure to double as the test — the same
argument `ingest_run`'s daily heartbeat won, one layer up.

**The cost, stated because it is real.** One more DAG in a list of eight, forever, and it is the only
one here designed to go red. Somebody will see `upto_alert_selftest` failed and spend ten minutes
finding out it means nothing. Three things are done about that and none of them removes it: the id
says `selftest`, the `description` says it, and the exception message itself reads *nothing is
wrong* — so the sentence that arrives on the phone and the sentence in the log both explain
themselves without this file being opened.

**Rejected: leaving the gap.** A10 works or it does not and we find out the first night something
breaks. Cheaper today, and it makes the first real failure the test — which is exactly the
arrangement that lets a dead channel sit dead for weeks. This whole item exists because nobody was
watching at 03:20.

**`schedule=None` and paused on arrival.** It must never run by itself: a DAG that fails on a timer
is an alert channel that cries wolf nightly, which is how a channel stops being read. Hand-triggered
only, and `is_paused_upon_creation=True` states the standing hazard as the intended state for once
rather than as a trap.

**`retries: 0`, and that is not a detail.** `on_failure_callback` fires when the task instance
finishes in FAILED state, which is after the retries are spent — so the repository's usual
`retries: 2, retry_delay: 10 minutes` would make this self-test take twenty minutes to send one
message. Zero here, and the message arrives in seconds.

Run it:
    docker compose exec airflow-scheduler airflow dags unpause upto_alert_selftest   # once
    docker compose exec airflow-scheduler airflow dags trigger upto_alert_selftest
    # the task goes red, and one Telegram message arrives. Re-pause it if you like; it
    # cannot run on its own either way, because it has no schedule.
